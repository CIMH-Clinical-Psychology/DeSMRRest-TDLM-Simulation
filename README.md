# DeSMRRest-RestingState-TDLM-Simulation

Code for the resting state analysis and simulation data using TDLM for the paper "Challenges in Replay Detection by TDLM in Post-Encoding Resting State"

For an overview of the experiment and results head to GH-pages: [Paper: Challenges in Replay Detection by TDLM in Post-Encoding Resting State](https://cimh-clinical-psychology.github.io/DeSMRRest-TDLM-Simulation/)

### 1. Getting started

First install the requirements using pip `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is recommended to run this in a dedicated environment not to mix up your current Python installation. You can do so e.g. using [conda env](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands).

```bash
conda create --name tdlm-sim python=3.10
conda activate tdlm-sim
# assuming you are in the folder of the repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download and setup

Then you need to specify your settings. Open `settings.py` and around line 117 insert where you want to store the data, or (if you have already downloaded it), where the data was saved. You can leave the other parameters the same.

```python
data_dir = '/path/to/data/'           # directory containing the FIF files
cache_dir = f'{data_dir}/cache/'      # used for caching
plot_dir = f'{data_dir}/plots/'       # plots will be stored here
log_dir = f'{data_dir}/plots/logs/'   # log files will be created here
```

Download the experiment files from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8001755) into a common folder. The files are split up into two repositories, 10.5281/zenodo.8001755 and 10.5281/zenodo.15629081. Instead of downloading them individually, you they can be downloaded automatically by running `python download_dataset.py` . This will utilize the Python API `pyzenodo3` and download the 140 GB dataset into your `data_dir`. This can take a while. 

### 3. Run analysis

Now you can simply run `run_analysis.py`. I personally used [Spyder](https://spyder-ide.org/ ) to run the script, which also nicely annotates the cells. It's included in Anaconda, so you might already have it installed.

All plots should appear in your plot_dir
